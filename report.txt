We perform the following tasks:
1) remove punctuations.
2) convert text into lower case for consistency
3) remove duplicate comments.
4) create packets of dataset for trianing.
5) creation of a Dictionary. LISTS ARE SLOW Af! -> The goal is to have a key value pairs like -> < key : comment_text <str>, toxic <int> >
