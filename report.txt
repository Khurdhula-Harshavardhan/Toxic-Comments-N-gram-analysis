for normalization:
We perform the following tasks:
1) remove punctuations.
2) convert text into lower case for consistency
3) remove duplicate comments.
4) create packets of dataset for trianing.
5) creation of a Dictionary. LISTS ARE SLOW Af! -> The goal is to have a key value pairs like -> < key : comment_text <str>, toxic <int> >


Important observations:

the score defined by a simple MLE() model is absolutely 0 or NEGATIVE INF! When we use ln.
However! I decided to use Laplace() model which seems to work well, although we still have 
very low probabilites.

-> Working with such low probabilites, might still lead to an Underflow Exception.

very hard to debug a fitted model each iteration, hence we try and use model persistence by using joblib.
